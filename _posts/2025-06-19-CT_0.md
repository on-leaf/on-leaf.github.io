# 0.Introduction
​	On this blog, I will be posting my study notes on Computed Tomography.<br>
Topics will include X-ray generation, tomography, reconstruction algorithms, and so on.<br>
My main references will be *Computed Tomography: Principles, Design, Artifacts, and Recent Advances* and *Computed Tomography: From Photon Statistics to Modern Cone-Beam CT*.<br>
I hope this will be helpful to you.<br>

Feedback is always welcome!

Thanks! :)
