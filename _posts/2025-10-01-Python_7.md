# 0.Introduction
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
`Set` is very different from sequence types. 
For example, a `list` maintains the insertion order of its items and can contain multiple identical items. 
In contrast, a `set` does not maintain order and cannot contain duplicate items.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 1.Set
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We can create a `set` using `{}` with items inside. 
However, in Python, using empty `{}` creates a `dict`, not an empty `set`.
```python
# s = {}: Trying to create an empty set this way will create a dictionary instead.
# To create an empty set, you must use the following syntax:
s_1 = {}
s_2 = set()

print(type(s_1), type(s_2))
```
```python
<class 'dict'> <class 'set'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Unlike `list` and `tuple`, a `set` does not maintain the order of its items. 
Duplicate items are removed, leaving only a single instance of each. 
Consequently, we cannot use indexing or slicing.
```python
s = {2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1}

print(s)
```
```python
{1, 2, 3}
```
<br>
```python
s = {"White", 10.01, 5, "Blue"}

print(s)
```
```python
{'White', 10.01, 'Blue', 5}
```
Like a `dict`, a `set` is a container that uses `{}`. 
However, because a `set` is unordered, it is not a container where items are linked to an index.
Since the elements are stored in an unordered way, we cannot rely on their position.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Conversion into `set`.
```python
t = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)
l = ["White", "Blue", "Blue", "Red", "Red", "Red"]

s_from_t = set(t)
s_from_l = set(l)

print(s_from_t, type(s_from_t))
print(s_from_l, type(s_from_l))
```
```python
{1, 2, 3} <class 'set'>
{'White', 'Red', 'Blue'} <class 'set'>
```
<br>
We can not recover removed items.
```python
t_from_s = tuple(s_from_t)
l_from_s = list(s_from_l)

print(t_from_s, type(t_from_s))
print(l_from_s, type(l_from_s))
```
```python
(1, 2, 3) <class 'tuple'>
['White', 'Red', 'Blue'] <class 'list'>
```

# 2.Operations of Set
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`.add()`
```python
s = {"White", "Blue", "Blue", "Red", "Red", "Red"}

s.add("Yellow")

print(s)
```
```python
{'White', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow'}
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Operations of `set`
```python
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Union: A.union(B)
print("Union:", A | B)

# Intersection: A.intersection(B)
print("Intersection:", A & B)

# Difference: A.difference(B)
print("Difference:", A - B)

# Symmetric Difference: A.symmetric_difference(B) (Union - Intersection)
print("Symmetric Difference:", A ^ B)
```
```python
Union: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Intersection: {2, 4}
Difference: {0, 8, 6}
Symmetric Difference: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
```
