# Abstract
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Dual energy material density images obtained by prereconstrucion basis material decomposition techniques offer specific tissue information, but they exhibit relatively high pixel noise. 
This paper show that noise in the material density images in negatively correlated and that can be exploited for noise reduction in the two basis material density images.
Authors proposed algorithm using negative correlation property.
This algorithm minimizes noise-related differences between pixels and their local mean values adgering to the constraint that monoenergetic CT values which have to remain unchanged.
When this algorithm applied to the material density images, a noise reduction by factors of 2 to 5 is achieved.
However, edge effects occured in the processed images. 
To suppress these, authors added locally adaptive algorithms.

# 1. Introduction
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
In general, dual energy techniques in X-ray CT offer additionaly and more specific information on the object than single energy techniques.
While standard CT yields linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) images, dual energy basis material decomposition techniques provide separate density images of the high and low atomic number materials (e.g., bone and water).
It seems to good to use dual energy rather than standard CT, however, images obtained by dual energy basis material decomposition suffer from high pixel noise levels.

Of coures, these noise can be reduce by an increase in exposure.
However, any noise reduction by a factor of $n$ requires an exposure increase by a factor of $n^2$ and it is not a good choice.
In this reason, the clinical use of dual energy methods has been restricted.

To reduce noise without an increase in exposure, many study are investigated.
One of them is reported by Macovski $\textit{et al}$.
Their basic idea was to reduce noise in a material-specific image $A$ by a low-pass filter operation and to restore structural information by superimposing a high-pass filtred version of a low-nosie, unspecific image $B$

<center>$$A' = A_{\text{low}} + C \cdot B_{\text{high}} \tag{1}$$</center>

The quality of the resultant image $A'$ depended on the control function $C$ which served for scailing and locally adapting this process.
Authors decided not to follow this approach because they wanted to conserve quantitative information.
<div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">

- Since the noise has randomness, noise can be compensated each other (high and low noise) when mean value of enough number of pixels is calcuated
- In method of Macovski, the balance of high and low noise can be break because of mixing of two images
</div>
Authors consider this mandatory for dual energy CT which above all is a quantitative technique.
The concept of them obeys the constraint that quantitative values for any meaningful ROI remain unchanged.
Their proposed method is tailored to material density images obtained by prereconstruction basis material decomposition techniques since it exploits the negative correlation between pixel noise in the two density images.
