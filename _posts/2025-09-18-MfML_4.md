# Introduction 
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We will add some geometric interpretation and intuition to concenpts of vectors, vector spaces, and linear mappings. 
To look at geometric vectors and compute their lengths and distances or angles between two vectors, we need to equip the vector space with an inner product that induces the geometry of the vector space.

# 1. Norms
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We will discuss the notion of the length of vectors using the concept of a norm.
