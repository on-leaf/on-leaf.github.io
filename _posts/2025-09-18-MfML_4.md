# Introduction 
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We will add some geometric interpretation and intuition to concenpts of vectors, vector spaces, and linear mappings. 
To look at geometric vectors and compute their lengths and distances or angles between two vectors, we need to equip the vector space with an inner product that induces the geometry of the vector space.

# 1. Norms
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We will discuss the notion of the length of vectors using the concept of a norm.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
**Definition 3.1 (Norm)**<br>
A **_norm_** on a vector space $V$ is a function.
<div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">
Assigns each vector $x$ its **_length_** $\Vert x \Vert \in \mathbb{R}$
</div>

$$\Vert \cdot \Vert: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \tag{3.1}$$

$$x \mapsto \Vert x \Vert \tag{3.2}$$

For all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in V$ the following hold:

- Absolutely homogeneous: $\Vert \lambda \vec{x} \Vert = \vert \lambda \vert \Vert \vec{x} \Vert$
- Triangle inequality: $\Vert \vec{x} + \vec{y} \Vert \le \Vert x \Vert + \Vert \vec{y} \Vert$
- Positive definite: $\Vert \vec{x} \Vert \ge 0$ and $\Vert \vec{x} \Vert = 0 \Leftrightarrow \vec{x} =\vec{0}$

**Example (Manhattan Norm)**<br>
The **_Manhattan norm_**, which is also called $\ell_1$ norm, on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined for $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ as

$$\Vert \vec{x} \Vert_1 := \sum_{i=1}^{n} \vert x_i \vert. \tag{3.3}$$

{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
**Example (Euclidean Norm)**<br>
The **_Euclidean norm_**, which is also called $\ell_2$ norm, of $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined as

$$\Vert \vec{x} \Vert_2 := \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} = \sqrt{\vec{x}^{\top} \vec{x}}. \tag{3.4}$$

The Euclidean norm will be used by default if not stated otherwise.

# 2. Inner Products
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Inner products is used for the length of a vector and the angle or distance between two vectors.
A major purpose of inner products is to determine whether vectors are orthogonal to each other.

## 2-1) Dot Product
The **_scalar product/dot product_** in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is given by 

$$\vec{x}^{\top} \vec{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \tag{3.5}$$

This particular inner product is usually called dot product.
However, inner products are more general concepts with specific properties, which are introduced next section.
