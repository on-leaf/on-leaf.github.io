# 1. Variables
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
## 1-1) Name of variables
A variable's name should express its meaning and function as concisely as possible. 

1. Use letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and the underscore (_). 
2. It cannot start with a number.
3. Spaces are not allowed.
4. Special symbols cannot be used (e.g., :",<>/?!@#$%^&*~-+).
5. It is case-sensitive (distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase).
6. Do not use predefined words in Python (reserved words).

To express meaning clearly, it is often necessary to combine multiple words, and there are two main styles for doing so. - Snake case and Camel case

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Snake case
: All words are written in lowercase and connected by underscores.

Ex) sanke_case, blue_apple, under_score
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Camel case
: The first letter of each word is capitalized to distinguish them.

Ex) CamelCase, RedBanana, UpperScore 
{% include end-box.html %}

The standard style guide for Python, recommends using the **snake_case** convention for function and variable names. 
**CamelCase** is recommended for the names of user-defined types (classes).

We can check the predefined keyword in Python as below.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Check all predefined keyword in Python
```python
import keyword

keyword.kwlist
```

Result is omitted. (Too long)
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Check single variable name whether it is predefined keyword in Python or not
```python
import keyword

keyword.iskeyword('blue_apple')
```
```python
False
```
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 2. Assignment operators
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Unlike assignment in mathematics, the assignment operator (=) in Python is more like attaching a name tag to an object in memory.

```python
a = 14
```
This code means that we want to give a name `a` on 7.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
There are various assignment operators.

```python
a += 5  # a = a + 5
a *= 13 # a = a * 13
a /= 7  # a = a / 7
a //= 2 # a = a//2
a **= 3 # a = a**3
a %= 4  # a = a % 4
```

These assignment operators perform both an operation and an assignment at the same time.
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 3. Cautions in variables
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We can use the `id` function to check if two variables are the same or different. 
The example below shows that even with the same variable name, they can be different variables.
```python
a = 15

print(id(a))

a = a + 10

print(id(a))
```
```python
2659584311984
2659584312304
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We can define multiple variables with different data type at the same time.
```python
a, b, c = 15, "Var", 8.74

print(type(a), type(b), type(c))
```
```python
<class 'int'> <class 'str'> <class 'float'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
When defining and using variables, we sometimes need a variable whose value should not be changed. 
However, since Python has no way to formally "lock" a variable's value, developers follow a convention for variables that shouldn't be modified: the name is written entirely in uppercase.

```python
PI = 3.141592
```

If you see a variable name in your code that is written entirely in uppercase, you should not change its value. 
(Although it's technically possible to do so, it's a convention you should follow).
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include end-box.html %}

# 4. Dynamic typing
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We can assign the same variable name to different data types.
This is called **Dynamic Typing**, which means the data type is not statically fixed but can be changed dynamically as needed. 
Since variables in Python are just names, attaching a new name tag to a existing variable doesn't turn the existing variable into a new variable.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Below example shows that the data type of variable `a` is changed when we assign new data type on `a`.
```python
a = 16
print(type(a))

a = 3.14
print(type(a))

a = "Dynamic typing!"
print(type(a))
```
```python
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'str'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 4-1) Mutability and Immutability
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We can assign multiple name tags (variable name) on same object.
```python
a = 1244
b = a

print(id(a))
print(id(b))
```
```python
2659686356208
2659686356208
```
They point same object since their `id` are same. 
However, the object has two name tags - `a` and `b`.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
However, when we try to change the value of `b`, its `id` will be different.
```python
b = b+1

print(id(a),a)
print(id(b), b)
```
```python
2659686356208 1244
2659686351792 1245
```
This is because instead of changing the value of the `b` object, a completely new object with the new value is created.
The reason why it happens is that the `int` data type is an immutable type, meaning the value of the object cannot be changed.

Python's data types include those whose values can be changed (**mutable**) and those whose values cannot be changed (**immutable**).
<div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1" style="font-size: 1em;">
- Immutable
: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `tuple`
- Mutable
: `list`, `dict`, `set`
