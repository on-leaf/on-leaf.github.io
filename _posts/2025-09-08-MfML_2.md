# Introduction 
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors.
Here, a bold letter represents a vector.

# 4. Vector Spaces
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
In the following, we will have a closer look at vector spaces, i.e., a structured space in which vectors live.
We will start by introducing the concept of a group, which is a set of elements and an operation defined on these elements that keeps some structure of the set intact.

## 4-1) Groups

**Definition 2.7 (Matrix)**<br>
Consider a set $\mathcal{G}$ and an operation $\otimes: \mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{G}$ defined on $\mathcal{G}$. 
Then $G:=(\mathcal{G}, \otimes)$ is called a group if the following hold:

1. _Closure_ of $\mathcal{G}$ under $\otimes$: $\forall x,y \in \mathcal{G}: x \otimes y \in mathcal{G}$
2. Associativity: $\forall x, y, z \in G : (x \otimes y) \otimes z = x \otimes (y \otimes z)$
3. Neutral element: $\exists e \in G \, \forall x \in G : x \otimes e = x \text{ and } e \otimes x = x$
4. Inverse element: $\forall x \in G \, \exists y \in G : x \otimes y = e \text{ and } y \otimes x = e$, where $e$ is the neutral element. We often write $x^{-1}$ to denote the inverse element of $x$.
