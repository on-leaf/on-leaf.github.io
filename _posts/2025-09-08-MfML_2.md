# Introduction 
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors.
Here, a bold letter represents a vector.

# 4. Vector Spaces
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
In the following, we will have a closer look at vector spaces, i.e., a structured space in which vectors live.
We will start by introducing the concept of a group, which is a set of elements and an operation defined on these elements that keeps some structure of the set intact.

## 4-1) Groups
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
**Definition 2.7 (Matrix)**<br>
Consider a set $\mathcal{G}$ and an operation $\otimes: \mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{G}$ defined on $\mathcal{G}$. 
Then $G:=(\mathcal{G}, \otimes)$ is called a group if the following hold:

1. _Closure_ of $\mathcal{G}$ under $\otimes$: $\forall x,y \in \mathcal{G}: x \otimes y \in \mathcal{G}$
2. Associativity: $\forall x, y, z \in G : (x \otimes y) \otimes z = x \otimes (y \otimes z)$
3. Neutral element: $\exists e \in G \, \forall x \in G : x \otimes e = x \text{ and } e \otimes x = x$
4. Inverse element: $\forall x \in G \, \exists y \in G : x \otimes y = e \text{ and } y \otimes x = e$, where $e$ is the neutral element. We often write $x^{-1}$ to denote the inverse element of $x$.

If additionally $\forall x,y \in \mathcal{G}: x \otimes y = y \otimes x$, then G = $(\mathcal{G}, \otimes)$ is an **_Abelian group_** (commutative).

**Example**
Let us have a look at some examples of sets with associated operations and see whether they are groups:
* $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is an Abelian group. 
* $(\mathbb{N} \cup {0}, +)$ is not a group. 
    <div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">
    : Although $(\mathbb{N}_0, +)$ possesses a neutral element (0), the inverse elements are missing.
    </div>
* $(\mathbb{Z}, \cdot)$ is not a group.
    <div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">
    : Although $(\mathbb{Z}, \cdot)$ contains a neutral element (1), the inverse elements for any $z \in \mathbb{Z}, z \neq \pm 1$, are missing.
    </div>
* $(\mathbb{R}, \cdot)$ is not a group since 0 does not possess an inverse element.
* $(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ is Abelian.
* $(\mathbb{R}^n, +), (\mathbb{Z}^n, +), n \in \mathbb{N}$ are Abelian if $+$ is defined componentwise, i.e., $(x_1, \dots, x_n) + (y_1, \dots, y_n) = (x_1 + y_1, \dots, x_n + y_n) \quad (4.1)$ Then, $(x_1, \dots, x_n)^{-1} := (-x_1, \dots, -x_n)$ is the inverse element and $e = (0, \dots, 0)$ is the neutral element.
* $(\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, +)$, the set of $m \times n$-matrices is Abelian (with componentwise addition as defined in (4.1)).
* $(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}, \cdot)$
    - Closure and associativity follow directly 
    - Neutral element: **_I_**$_n$
    - The inverse **_A_**$^{-1}$ may exist or not. So, generally, it is not a group. However, the set of invertible matrices in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with matrix multiplicationis a group, called **_general linear group_**. 
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
**General Linear Group**<br>
The set of regular (invertible) matrices **_A_** $\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a group with respect to matrix multiplcation as defined in (2.3, $c_{ij} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{il} b_{lj}, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m, \quad j = 1, \ldots, k$) and is called **_general linear group GL_** $(n,\mathbb{R})$. However, since matrix multiplication is not commutative, the group in not Abelian. 
{% include end-box.html %}

## 4-2) Vector Spaces
When we discussed groups, we looked at sets $\mathcal{G}$ and inner opeerations on $\mathcal{G}$, i.e., mappings $\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{G}$ that only operate on elements in $\mathcal{G}$. 
We will consider sets with an inner operation $+$, an outer operation $\cdot$ and the multiplication of a vector $x \in \mathcal{G}$ by a scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. 
<div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">
We can think of the inner operation as a form of addition, and the outer operation asa form of scailing, but the inner/outer operations have nothing to do with inner/outer products.
</div>

**Definition 2.9 (Vector Space)**<br>
A real-valued _vector space_ $V = (\mathcal{V}, +, \cdot)$ is a set $\mathcal{V}$ with two operations

<center>$$ +: \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathcal{V} \tag{4.2}$$</center>
<center>$$ \cdot: \mathcal{R}\times \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathcal{V} \tag{4.3}$$</center>

where

1. $(\mathcal{V}, +)$ is an Abelian group
2. Distributivity:<br>
    1) $\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{R}, x, y \in \mathcal{V} : \lambda \cdot (x+y) = \lambda \cdot x + \lambda \cdot y$<br>
    2) $\forall \lambda, \psi \in \mathbb{R}, x \in \mathcal{V} : (\lambda + \psi) \cdot x = \lambda \cdot x + \psi \cdot x$
3. Associativity (outer operation): $\forall \lambda,\psi \in \mathbb{R}, x \in \mathcal{V}: \lambda \cdot(\psi \cdot x) = (\lambda \psi)\cdot x$
4. Neutral element with repsect to the outer operation: $\forall x \in \mathcal{V}: 1 \cdot x = x$

    <div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">

    - The elements $x \in V$ are called **_vectors_**.
    - The neutral element of $(\mathcal{V}, +)$ is the zero vector **0** = $[0, \dots, 0]^{\top}$
    - The inner operation $+$ is called _vector addition_
    - The elements $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ 
    </div>
