# Introduction
In English, the word "function" refers to a purpose or capability. 
In computer programming, a function is a named block of statements grouped together to perform a specific task.

Until now, we have studied from the perspective of how to use the various functions that are either built-in to Python or provided by packages. 
From now on, let's gradually shift our perspective towards creating various functions ourselves and combining them to build progressively larger and more complex programs.

The syntax for functions is not difficult, as it's primarily designed for the programmer's convenience. 

If you develop the skill to first grasp the input-output relationship of each function from an abstract viewpoint to unravel the overall structure, you won't be intimidated when building large and complex programs.

`Input -> Function -> Output`

After we review the useful concepts and syntax related to functions, in the following sections we will learn how to properly utilize them one by one as we build various programs.

# 1.Function
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
## 1-1) Process to make `function`
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
1. Consider how to break down the overall program.
2. Define the input and output for each individual function.
3. Implement the function according to the syntax.
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-2) Format of `function`
The basic syntax for a function is as follows:
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
    """You can add a description of the function's purpose here."""
    
    # Statements that perform a task or calculate a return value
    
    return return_value # or an expression that calculates the return value
```
- When creating a function, you use the `def` keyword, which stands for "define."
- In Python, function names are conventionally written in snake_case.
- Inside the parentheses `()`, you can list the parameters required for the `function` to perform its task. Even for a `function` with no parameters, the parentheses are still required.
- At the beginning of the `function` body, you can insert a description of the `function` between triple quotes (`"""`). This is called a `docstring` and is syntactically a multi-line string.
- The `return` statement ends the function's execution and sends a value back to the place where the function was called.
- If the expression to the right of `return` is omitted, or if the `return` statement itself is omitted, the function will implicitly return `None`.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`function` example
```python
def add_two(a, b):
    # Inside the function body, `a` and `b` can be used like variables.
    
    temp = a + b
    
    return temp

result = add_two(1, 2)

print(result)
```
```python
3
```
When you call the function by passing 1 and 2 in the parameter positions, the function calculates temp as if 1 were assigned to a and 2 were assigned to b. 
When temp is returned, its value is sent back to the place where the `function` was called, and it is then assigned to the result variable.

a and b as used in the function definition are called parameters. 
The actual values, 1 and 2, that are passed into the function when it is called are called **_arguments_**.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We can also use expressions as arguments.

```python
def add_two(a, b):
    temp = a + b
    return temp

x = 1

# An argument passed as an expression
result = add_two(x + 100, 2) 

print(result)
```
```python
103
```
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 2.Parameters
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
When passing arguments to a function, we must match the number and order of the parameters defined in the function's signature.
```python
def repeat_print(message, count):
    """Prints the message 'count' number of times."""
    
    for _ in range(count):
        print(message)
        
repeat_print("Hello", 3)
```
```python
Hello
Hello
Hello
```
This method of passing arguments is called using **_positional arguments_** because you must exactly match the order of the arguments to the order of the parameters.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
When passing arguments, we can ignore the order if you explicitly specify which parameter each argument should go to. 
This is called using **_keyword arguments_**.
```python
def repeat_print(message, count):
    """Prints the message 'count' number of times."""

    for _ in range(count):
        print(message)

# When using keyword arguments,
# no error occurs even if the order of the arguments
# is different from the defined order of the parameters.
repeat_print(count=3, message="Hello")
```
```python
Hello
Hello
Hello
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We can also set default values for parameters. 
If an argument is not provided for a parameter that has a default value, Python will automatically use that default. 
This means you don't have to supply every argument for every function call.
```python
def repeat_print(message="Hi", count=1):
    """Prints the message 'count' number of times."""
    
    for _ in range(count):
        print(message)
    print() # For a newline

# Call with no arguments; both defaults are used.
repeat_print()

# Call with one positional argument; the default for 'count' is used.
repeat_print("Hello")

# Call with one keyword argument; the default for 'message' is used.
repeat_print(count=2)
```
```python
Hi

Hello

Hi
Hi
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
When using positional arguments, if you provide fewer arguments than the total number of parameters, the arguments are assigned to the parameters from left to right.
```python
# Order: message, count
def repeat_print(message="Hello", count=1):
    """Prints message count times"""
    for _ in range(count):
        print(message)

repeat_print(3)
```
```python
3
```
<br>
```python
# Order: count, message
def repeat_print(count=1, message="Hello"):
    """Prints message count times"""
    for _ in range(count):
        print(message)

repeat_print(3)
```
```python
Hello
Hello
Hello
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We do not have to set a default value for every parameter, but parameters without default values must come before parameters with default values. 
It is standard practice to place required parameters (those that must always receive an argument) further to the left in the function definition.
```python
# 'message' (no default) comes before 'count' (has a default).
def repeat_print(message, count=1):
    """Prints the message 'count' number of times."""
    for _ in range(count):
        print(message)
```
