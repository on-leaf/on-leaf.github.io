# 1. Strings
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
A **_string_** is a convenient data type for handling characters that are arranged in a sequence.
It is classified as one of the **_container_** data types because it can hold multiple characters. 
Among container types, it is further classified as a **_sequence_** because its elements are arranged in a specific order.
Data types classified as sequences include not only strings but also **_list_** and **_tuple_**.
In a sequence, we can use indexing and slicing.

## 1-1) Making string literal
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We can use both `"` and `'` to make strings.
```python
"Blue apple"
'Blue apple'
```
```python
'Blue apple'
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
To use `'` in string, we need to use `"` or `'` with `\`.
```python
"I'm Python learner."
'I\'m Python learner.'
```
```python
"I'm Python learner."
```

<br>
To use `"` in string, we need to use `'` or `"` with `\`. 
```python
"Learning \"Python\"."
'Learning "Python".'
```
```python
'Learning "Python".'
```

Like `\'` or `\"`, symbols with `\` are called **_escape character_**. 
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-2) Printing strings
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We can use `print()` to print out strings.

```python
print("Red banana!")
print("Blue apple?")
```
```python
Red banana!
Blue apple?
```

<br>
And we can give a "new line" by using `\n`.

```python
print("Red \nBlue")
```
```python
Red 
Blue
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
`\t` is used for `tab`.
```python
print("Giving \tspace")
```
```python
Giving 	space
```

<br>
`\t` gives space for eight characters.

```python
print("\t12345678")
print("1\t12345678")
print("12\t12345678")
print("123\t12345678")
print("1234\t12345678")
print("12345\t12345678")
print("123456\t12345678")
print("1234567\t12345678")
print("12345678\t12345678")
```
```python
	12345678
1	12345678
12	12345678
123	12345678
1234	12345678
12345	12345678
123456	12345678
1234567	12345678
12345678	12345678
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
`\b`: backspace

```python
print("Python!")
print("Python!\b")
```
```python
Python!
Python
```
{% include end-box.html %}









{% include end-box.html %}






{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

{% include end-box.html %}
