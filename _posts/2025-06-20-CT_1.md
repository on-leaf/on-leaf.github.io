# 0.Introduction
​	Computed Tomography (CT) is a powerful imaging modality in the medical field that utilizes X-rays to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures. <br>
This non-invasive technique provides crucial diagnostic information without any invasion into body. <br>
While other imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged, CT remains the most widely used imaging technology in diagnostic radiology due to its speed, accessibility, and high spatial resolution.<br>

Nevertheless, CT technology still faces several challenges, such as radiation dose and image artifacts.<br>
These limitations present exciting opportunities for improvement, particularly with the integration of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI).<br>
To fully appreciate these challenges and potential solutions, an understanding of the basics is essential. <br>

In this post, we will begin by exploring the fundamental types of CT systems and how X-rays are generated.	



# 1.Types of CT

​	Types of CT can be sorted by its beam geometry. 

## 1) Parallel-beam geometry

	Parallel-beam geometry CT is also called  first-generation CT. <br>
In this type of CT, only one X-ray beam from x-ray source (looks like pencil) is used to get tomography. <br>The x-ray source and detector for x-ray beam move linearly to scan whole body.
