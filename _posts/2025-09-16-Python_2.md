# 1. Number & Data type
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Data types clearly tell us what kind of values can be used and what operations can be performed. 
Python provides the Built-in Numeric types by default.

| Data type | Numbers | Example | Property |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| int | integer | 0 10 -5 | No limits |
| float | real | 0.0 1.0 -6.0 3.14 0.15e2 | Use floating point representation |
| complex | complex | 1.0 + 2.0j | float is used for real and complex part |

{% include end-box.html %}

# 2. Integer
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

## 2-1) Size of integer
Since there are no limits for integer, large size of number get larger size than number of smaller size.

```python
import sys

a = 123
b = 65928784654621341

print(sys.getsizeof(a)) 
print(sys.getsizeof(b))
```
```python
28
32
```

## 2-2) Operations for integer
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Division /
```python
10 / 2
```
```python
5
```
Data type of output is `float`.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Division //
```python
15 // 2
```
```python
7
```
Data type of output is `int`
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Remainder %
```python
9 % 2
```
```python
1
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Share and remainder
```python
divmod(17,4)
```
```python
(4, 1)
```
Output is consist of share and remainder with `()`.
This type of data is called `tuple`.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Power operation
```python
3**4
```
```python
81
```
<br>
```python
pow(3, 4)
```
```python
81
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`int` $\rightarrow$ `float`
```python
int(17)
```
```python
17.0
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include end-box.html %}

# 3. Float
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

## 3-1) Representation of float - Exponential notation
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Exponential notation of float
```python
514.12345e3
```
```python
514123.45
```
Number $n$ after `e` means $10^n$.
{% include end-box.html %}

## 3-2) Operations for float
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
+, -, *, /
```python
12.5 + 4
```
```python
16.5
```
Four operations, +, -, *, /, for integer and float, output is float.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Division //
```python
12.345 // 1
```
```python
12.0
```
If any operand in floor division (//) is a float, the result will be a float with the decimal part as .0.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Remainder
```python
13.0 % 3
```
```python
1.0
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`float` $\rightarrow$ `int`
```python
int(17.4)
```
```python
17
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
[Note] Floating-point representation stores a real number by dividing it into three parts: sign, significand, and exponent.
Because it internally uses a binary (base-2) system, precision problems arise from a decimal (base-10) perspective.

{% include end-box.html %}

# 4. Complex number
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Making complex number
```python
3 + 4j
```
```python
(3+4j)
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Conjugate
```python
(10 + 4j).conjugate()
```
```python
(10-4j)
```

{% include end-box.html %}
