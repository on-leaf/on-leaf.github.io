# Abstract
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
$\bullet$ Purpose
: Smaller pixel sizes of x-ray photon counting detectors (PCDs) have
  <div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">
  Advantages
  - Better count rate capability
  </div>

  <div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">
  Disadvantages
  - Charge sharing (The split of an x-ray photon energy) 
    <div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">

    - One photon may produce two or more counts at adjacent pixels
    - 90keV photon can be measured as 30keV and 90keV
    - Hard to fix position of measured photon
  </div>
  
  This "double-counting" produced by charge sharing increases noise variance and degrades the spectral response. 
  In this reason, charge sharing has negative impact on the PCD-based computed tomography (CT) performance.
  But, charge sharing is impossible to avoid. (It is induced by the detection physics and occurs regardless of count rates)
  In this paper, a method that has a potential to address both noise and bias added by charge sharing is proposed.

$\bullet$ Methods
: In this paper, a multi-energy inter-pixel coincidence cunter (MEICC) technique is proposed.
  This technique uses energy-dependent coincidence counters, keeps the book of charge sharing envents during data acquisition and provieds the exact number of charge sharing occurrences, which can be used to either correct of compensate for them after the acquisition is completed.
  <div class="indented-paragraph" markdown="1">
  This process does not interfere with the primary couting process
  </div>
  Authors evaluated Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of PCDs with and without MEICC using Monte Carlo simulation.
