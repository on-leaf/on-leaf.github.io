# 0.Introduction
$\quad$ We will take a closer look at X-ray generation and so on.

# 1.Focal spot size & Anode angle
$\quad$ Let's examine two factors that influence image quality: the focal spot size and the anode angle.

## 1-1) Focal spot
The focal spot is the area on the target material where electrons collide to generate X-rays.

Ideally, all electrons would strike a single, infinitesimally small point. 
However, in reality, it's impossible for countless electrons to hit the exact same spot. Instead, they impact a small, specific area, which we call the focal spot.

The size of this focal spot directly affects image quality. 
A smaller focal spot results in higher spatial resolution. However, this comes with a trade-off: a smaller focal spot can handle less power, which means lower X-ray output and potentially longer exposure times.

## 1-2) Anode angle
Next, let's look at the anode angle, which is a key factor in determining the focal spot size.

The anode angle refers to the angle of inclination of the target material, as illustrated in the image above. The image shows target materials with different anode angles.<br><br>
Here's how they are related: <br>
$\bullet$ A smaller anode angle leads to a shorter "focal spot length" along the slope, resulting in a smaller effective focal spot size.<br> 
$\bullet$ Conversely, a larger anode angle creates a longer focal spot length, resulting in a larger effective focal spot size.<br><br>
In summary, the anode angle is directly proportional to both the effective focal spot size and the power handling capacity, while being inversely proportional to the final image resolution.
