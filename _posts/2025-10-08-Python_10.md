# Introduction
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Let's explore methods for repetition, a part of program flow control. 
While there are words like 'repeat' and 'iterate' for repetition, programming often favors iterate. 
This is because it usually implies repetition with slight variations, which is more common than simply repeating the exact same thing. 
This is also known as creating a **_loop_**.

There are two main ways to create a loop for repetition: `for` and `while`. 
While they are theoretically interchangeable, their practical use cases differ.

- A `for` loop is generally used when the number of iterations or the range to loop over is known before the loop starts.
- A `while` loop is typically used when the loop needs to continue as long as a certain condition is true, rather than for a fixed number of times.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 1.`for` loop
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
## 1-1) General form of `for` loop
Let's look at general form of `for` loop.
```python
for variable in iterable_object:
    # Statements to be repeated
else:
    # Statements to execute after the loop finishes (without a `break`)
```
Between `in` and `:`, we can place an iterable object—an object that can be looped over. For example, objects of numeric data types like `int` or `float` cannot be used here, but container types like `list` or `tuple` can. To iterate over a range of integers, we can create and use a `range` object. The `variable` is successively assigned each item provided by the iterable.

```python
# How to check if an object is iterable
from collections.abc import Iterable

isinstance(1, Iterable), isinstance([1, 2, 3], Iterable), isinstance(range(3), Iterable)
```
```python
(False, True, True)
```

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`for` loop
```python
for i in [8, 3, 5]:  # i will be assigned the values 8, 3, and 5 in sequence.
    j = i * 10
    print(j)
```
```python
80
30
50
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`else`<br>
In a `for` or `while` loop, the code in the `else` block is executed only if the loop completes its full sequence without being interrupted by a break statement. 
While the syntax looks similar to the `else` in an `if` statement, its meaning is completely different.
```python
for i in [8,3,5]:
    j = i*10
    print(j)
else:
    print("Done")
```
```python
80
30
50
Done
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-2) `range`
We can create a range of integers using the `range()` function. It is typically used together with `for` loops.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Type of `range`
```python
type(range(5))
```
```python
range
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Argument of `range()`: range(start, end, step)
```python
# If you provide only one number, it acts as the 'stop' value.
# In this case, the start defaults to 0 and the step defaults to 1.
for i in range(5):
    print(i, end=" ")
```
```python
0 1 2 3 4 
```
<br>
```python
# If you provide two numbers, they act as the 'start' and 'stop' values.
# The step defaults to 1.
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i, end=" ")
```
```python
1 2 3 4 5 
```
<br>
```python
# You can skip numbers by providing a 'step' value.
for i in range(1, 6, 2):
    print(i, end=" ")
```
```python
1 3 5 
```
<br>
```python
# You can also use a negative step to count backward.
for i in range(5, 0, -2):
    print(i, end=" ")
```
```python
5 3 1 
```
<br>
```python
# Of course, a range object can be assigned to a variable.
r = range(3)
for i in r:
    print(i)
```
```python
0
1
2
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-3) Use `for` loop with container
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`for` with `str`
```python
# Using with a String
for i in "Hello?":
    print(i)
```
```python
H
e
l
l
o
?
```
<br>
```python
# When 'end' is an empty string
for i in "Hello?":
    print(i, end="")
```
```python
Hello?
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`for` with `tuple`
```python
# Using with a Tuple
for i in (5, 7, 3):
    print(i)
```
```python
5
7
3
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`for` with `dict`
```python
# Looping over a dictionary (iterates through keys)
for k in {"White":"banana", "Blue":"apple"}:
    print(k)
```
```python
White
Blue
```
<br>
```python
# Dictionary .keys()
for k in {"White":"banana", "Blue":"apple"}.keys():
    print(k)
```
```python
White
Blue
```
<br>
```python
# Dictionary .values()
for v in {"White":"banana", "Blue":"apple"}.values():
    print(v)
```
```python
banana
apple
```
<br>
```python
# Let's check the data type of the items from .items()
for item in {"White":"banana", "Blue":"apple"}.items():
    print(item)
```
```python
('White', 'banana')
('Blue', 'apple')
```
<br>
```python
# You can unpack the items from .items()
for k, v in {"White":"banana", "Blue":"apple"}.items():
    print(f"{k} -> {v}")
```
```python
White -> banana
Blue -> apple
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-4) Changing item of `list` using `for`
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
immutable item case
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(my_list, id(my_list[0]), id(my_list[1]), id(my_list[2]))

for i in my_list:
    print("Before:", id(i), i)
    i *= 10
    print("After:", id(i), i)
    print()

print(my_list, id(my_list[0]), id(my_list[1]), id(my_list[2]))
```
```python
[1, 2, 3] 2269211394288 2269211394320 2269211394352
Before: 2269211394288 1
After: 2269211394576 10

Before: 2269211394320 2
After: 2269211394896 20

Before: 2269211394352 3
After: 2269211395216 30

[1, 2, 3] 2269211394288 2269211394320 2269211394352
```
Since `int` is an immutable type, changing its value creates a new object.
However, once a list is created, changing the original variables used to create it does not affect the elements inside the list.
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
mutable item case
```python
my_list = [[1], [2], [3]]

print(my_list, id(my_list[0]), id(my_list[1]), id(my_list[2]))

for i in my_list:
    i[0]*=2

print(my_list, id(my_list[0]), id(my_list[1]), id(my_list[2]))
```
```python
[[1], [2], [3]] 2269292876672 2269292524992 2269292877632
[[2], [4], [6]] 2269292876672 2269292524992 2269292877632
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Changing immutable item using indexing
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(my_list, id(my_list), id(my_list[0]), id(my_list[1]), id(my_list[2]))

for i in range(len(my_list)):
    my_list[i]*=2

print(my_list, id(my_list), id(my_list[0]), id(my_list[1]), id(my_list[2]))
```
```python
[1, 2, 3] 2269314292608 2269211394288 2269211394320 2269211394352
[2, 4, 6] 2269314292608 2269211394320 2269211394384 2269211394448
```
Immutable item can be changed by indexing.
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-5) `for` loop with `if`
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`if` in `for` loop
```python
for num in range(6):
    if num%2 == 0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")
```
```python
Even
Odd
Even
Odd
Even
Odd
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`for` loop in `if`
```python
user_input = 6

if user_input % 2 ==0 :
    for i in range(user_input):
        print("Even", end=" ")

```
```python
Even Even Even Even Even Even 
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-6) Nested `for` loop
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Summation of given nested list
```python
my_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]

my_sum = 0

for i in my_list:
    for j in i:
        my_sum += j

print(my_sum)
```
```python
21
```
<br>
Summation of given nested list and non-list item
```python
my_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], 7]

my_sum = 0

for i in my_list:
    if isinstance(i, list):
        for j in i:
            my_sum += j
    else:
        my_sum += i

print(my_sum)
```
```python
28
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 1-7) `enumerate()`
We can use `enumerate()` in a `for` loop when we need both the item and its index at the same time.
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
```python
my_list = ["White", "Blue", "Red"]

# enumerate()
for index, item in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f"Index {index}: Item - {item}")
    
```
```python
Index 0: Item - White
Index 1: Item - Blue
Index 2: Item - Red
```
<br>
```python
my_dict = {"White":"madarin", "Blue":"apple", "Red":"banana"}

# enumerate()
for index, item in enumerate(my_dict):
    print(f"Index {index}: Item - {item}")
    
```
```python
Index 0: Item - White
Index 1: Item - Blue
Index 2: Item - Red
```

{% include end-box.html %}
