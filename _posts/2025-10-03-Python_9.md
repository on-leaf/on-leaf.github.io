# 1.Expression and Statement
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

## 1-1) Expression
An expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to a single value.
```python
1.0 + abs(a) * b
a > 1
```

## 1-2) Statement
A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. 
This includes assignment statements, which we have used frequently, as well as conditional statements and loop statements (or iteration). 
Function calls that perform an action, such as `print()`, are also considered statements. 
Essentially, the lines of code you write in a `.py` file are made up of statements.

## 1-3) Block
In Python, a group of statements with the same indentation level is called a block. 
In the example below, the `print()` statements on lines 2 and 3 can be seen as one block. 

```python
1: if 1 < a < 3:
2:     print("Larger than 1.")
3:     print("Smaller than 3.")
```

This is intuitive thanks to indentation. 
Blank lines are ignored.

Let's introduce a few more terms. 
In the syntax above, the first line is called a clause because it determines whether the block on lines 2-3 will be executed. 
In Python, a line like the first one (e.g., `if` ..., `for` ..., `else`:) is called the header, and the indented block on lines 2-3 is called the suite (or body). 

So far, we have learned how to use basic data types. From now on, let's seriously explore how to use these data types and statements to create programs.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 2.Boolean data type
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Objects of the Boolean data type have only two possible values: `True` and `False`.
They are used to control the flow of a program, typically in the conditional expressions of `if` statements and to manage the logic of `while` loops.

## 2-1) Data type of Boolean
Data type of Boolean is `bool`.
```python
type(True), type(False)
```
```python
(bool, bool)
```

## 2-2) Boolean operators for comparison 
The examples in the table below assume x = 1 and y = 2.

|Operator| Description | Example|
|:---:|:---|:---|
|```==```|Equal to|```(x == y)```is ```False```|
|```!=```|Not equal to|```(x != y)```is ```True```|
|```>```|Greater than|```(x > y)```is ```False```|
|```<```|Less than|```(x < y)```is ```True```|
|```>=```|Greater than or equal to|```(x >= y)```is ```False```|
|```<=```|Less than or equal to|```(x <= y)```is ```True```|

## 2-3) Boolean operators `and`

|Operator| Description | Example|
|---|---|---|
|```True and True```|```True```|```(1 < 2 and 3 < 4)```는 ```True```|
|```False and True```|```False```|```(1 > 2 and 3 < 4)```는 ```False```|
|```True and False```|```False```|```(1 < 2 and 3 > 4)```는 ```False```|
|```False and False```|```False```|```(1 > 2 and 3 > 4)```는 ```False```|

## 2-4) Boolean operators `or`

|Operator| Description | Example|
|---|---|---|
|```True or True```|```True```|```(1 < 2 or 3 < 4)```는 ```True```|
|```False or True```|```True```|```(1 > 2 or 3 < 4)```는 ```True```|
|```True or False```|```True```|```(1 < 2 or 3 > 4)```는 ```True```|
|```False or False```|```False```|```(1 > 2 or 3 > 4)```는 ```False```|

## 2-5) Boolean operators `not`

|Operator| Description | Example|
|---|---|---|
|```not True```|```False```|```not 1 < 2```는 ```False```|
|```not False```|```True```|```not 1 > 2```는 ```True```|

## 2-6) Chanined comparison
We can write expressions that use `and` more concisely.
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

print(b < a and c < a)
print(b < a > c)  # More concise
```
```python
False
False
```

## 2-7) Identify operator
The `is` operator compares whether two variables refer to the same object. 
If their `id()` is the same, they are the same object. 
Be careful, as this is different from `==`, which compares whether their values are equal.

```python
a = 123
b = a
c = 123.0

print("a is b:", a is b)

print("a is c:", a is c)
print("a == c", a == c)
```
```python
a is b: True
a is c: False
a == c True
```

## 2-8) Relationship between Booleans and other data types
Internally, the `bool` type is a subclass of the `int` type.
```python
isinstance(True, int), isinstance(False, int), isinstance(5, int)
```
```python
(True, True, True)
```

## 2-9) Conversion into `bool`
Non-zero values are converted into `True`.
```python
bool(0), bool(0.0), bool(1), bool(2), bool("a")
```
```python
(False, False, True, True, True)
```
<br>
`None` is converted into `False`
```python
bool(None)
```
```python
False
```
`None` is sometimes used as a temporary placeholder for a variable when its final `True` or `False` value hasn't been determined yet.
