# 1.Expression and Statement
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

## 1-1) Expression
An expression is a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to a single value.
```python
1.0 + abs(a) * b
a > 1
```

## 1-2) Statement
A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. 
This includes assignment statements, which we have used frequently, as well as conditional statements and loop statements (or iteration). 
Function calls that perform an action, such as `print()`, are also considered statements. 
Essentially, the lines of code you write in a `.py` file are made up of statements.

## 1-3) Block
In Python, a group of statements with the same indentation level is called a block. 
In the example below, the `print()` statements on lines 2 and 3 can be seen as one block. 

```python
1: if 1 < a < 3:
2:     print("Larger than 1.")
3:     print("Smaller than 3.")
```

This is intuitive thanks to indentation. 
Blank lines are ignored.

Let's introduce a few more terms. 
In the syntax above, the first line is called a clause because it determines whether the block on lines 2-3 will be executed. 
In Python, a line like the first one (e.g., `if` ..., `for` ..., `else`:) is called the header, and the indented block on lines 2-3 is called the suite (or body). 

So far, we have learned how to use basic data types. From now on, let's seriously explore how to use these data types and statements to create programs.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 2.Boolean data type
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Objects of the Boolean data type have only two possible values: `True` and `False`.
They are used to control the flow of a program, typically in the conditional expressions of `if` statements and to manage the logic of `while` loops.

## 2-1) Data type of Boolean
Data type of Boolean is `bool`.
```python
type(True), type(False)
```
```python
(bool, bool)
```

## 2-2) Boolean operators for comparison 
The examples in the table below assume x = 1 and y = 2.

|Operator| Description | Example|
|:---:|:---|:---|
|```==```|Equal to|```(x == y)```is ```False```|
|```!=```|Not equal to|```(x != y)```is ```True```|
|```>```|Greater than|```(x > y)```is ```False```|
|```<```|Less than|```(x < y)```is ```True```|
|```>=```|Greater than or equal to|```(x >= y)```is ```False```|
|```<=```|Less than or equal to|```(x <= y)```is ```True```|

## 2-3) Boolean operators `and`

|Operator| Description | Example|
|---|---|---|
|```True and True```|```True```|```(1 < 2 and 3 < 4)```is ```True```|
|```False and True```|```False```|```(1 > 2 and 3 < 4)```is ```False```|
|```True and False```|```False```|```(1 < 2 and 3 > 4)```is ```False```|
|```False and False```|```False```|```(1 > 2 and 3 > 4)```is ```False```|

## 2-4) Boolean operators `or`

|Operator| Description | Example|
|---|---|---|
|```True or True```|```True```|```(1 < 2 or 3 < 4)```is ```True```|
|```False or True```|```True```|```(1 > 2 or 3 < 4)```is ```True```|
|```True or False```|```True```|```(1 < 2 or 3 > 4)```is ```True```|
|```False or False```|```False```|```(1 > 2 or 3 > 4)```is ```False```|

## 2-5) Boolean operators `not`

|Operator| Description | Example|
|---|---|---|
|```not True```|```False```|```not 1 < 2```is ```False```|
|```not False```|```True```|```not 1 > 2```is ```True```|

## 2-6) Chanined comparison
We can write expressions that use `and` more concisely.
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

print(b < a and c < a)
print(b < a > c)  # More concise
```
```python
False
False
```

## 2-7) Identify operator
The `is` operator compares whether two variables refer to the same object. 
If their `id()` is the same, they are the same object. 
Be careful, as this is different from `==`, which compares whether their values are equal.

```python
a = 123
b = a
c = 123.0

print("a is b:", a is b)

print("a is c:", a is c)
print("a == c", a == c)
```
```python
a is b: True
a is c: False
a == c True
```

## 2-8) Relationship between Booleans and other data types
Internally, the `bool` type is a subclass of the `int` type.
```python
isinstance(True, int), isinstance(False, int), isinstance(5, int)
```
```python
(True, True, True)
```

## 2-9) Conversion into `bool`
Non-zero values are converted into `True`.
```python
bool(0), bool(0.0), bool(1), bool(2), bool("a")
```
```python
(False, False, True, True, True)
```
<br>
`None` is converted into `False`
```python
bool(None)
```
```python
False
```
`None` is sometimes used as a temporary placeholder for a variable when its final `True` or `False` value hasn't been determined yet.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 3.Conditional statement `if`
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
"if" means "on the condition that." 
In Python, an `if` statement controls the program's execution, directing its flow based on whether a certain condition is met. 
For this reason, it is also known as a **_conditional statement_** or **_branching statement_**.

`if` can be used by itself, or it can be combined with `else` and `elif`. 
The `if` statement executes its code block only if the expression between `if` and the colon (`:`) evaluates to True. 
If the expression is `False`, the block is skipped.

## 3-1) `if` statement
Between the `if` keyword and the colon (`:`), write an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
```python
if True:
    print("Print always!")
```
```python
Print always!
```
<br>
```python
if False:
    print("No print")
```
```python

```
<br>
```python
num_if = 15

if num_if > 5:
    print("num_if larger than 5")
```
```python
num_if larger than 5
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 3-2) `else`
"else" means "otherwise." 
In Python, we can use an `else` clause to specify a block of code that will run if the if condition evaluates to False.
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
```python
if True:
    print("True!")
else:
    print("False!")
```
```python
True!
```
<br>
```python
if False:
    print("True!")
else:
    print("False!")
```
```python
False!
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 3-3) `elif`
While `if` and `else` allow us to control the flow for two possibilities, we can use `elif` to add more diverse conditions.
`elif` is short for "else if." 
It allows us to check for a new condition if the previous conditions were not `True`.
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
```python
num = int(input("Please input your number:"))

if num == 1:
    print(f"Given number is {num}.")
elif num == 2:
    print(f"Given number is {num}.")
elif num == 3:
    print(f"Given number is {num}.")
else:
    print("Out of range.")
```
```python
Given number is 2.
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 3-4) `match-case`
The `match-case` statement is similar to a `switch-case` statement in other languages, but it's much more powerful. It allows you to check a value against a series of patterns and execute a block of code when a match is found.
Think of it as a cleaner and more powerful alternative to a long chain of `if-elif-else` statements.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
```python
num_match = 1

match num_match: 
    case 1:
        print("num_match is 1.")
    case 2:
        print("num_match is 2.")
    case _: # Nothing matched 
        print("Out of range.")
```
```python
num_match is 1.
```
