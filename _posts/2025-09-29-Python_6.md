# 0.Introduction
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
`Tuples` are similar to `lists` in that they can hold objects of various data types. 
However, the critical difference is that `tuples` are immutable, which leads to differences in how they are used.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 1.Tuple
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
`Tuples` are created using `()` and `,`. 
However, if a `,` is present, the `()` can sometimes be omitted.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Various method to make tuple
```python
# An empty tuple
t = ()

# Using `()` and `,`
t = (1, 2, 3)

# Can hold objects of different data types
t = ("Hello", 3.14, 123)

# A trailing `,` is required to create a tuple with a single item. Without it, it's just a string.
t = ("hello",)

# Omitting `()` when creating a tuple is also known as packing.
t = 1, 2, 3    
```
<br>
How to make single item `tuple`.
```python
# A trailing comma is required to create a tuple with a single item. Without it, it's just a string.
t = "hello"
print(type(t))

t = ("hello")
print(type(t))

t = ("hello",)
print(type(t))

```
```python
<class 'str'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'tuple'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Convert `list` into `tuple`.
```python
list_test = ["White", 13, ["Blue", 0]]
print(type(list_test))

tuple_test = tuple(list_test)
print(type(tuple_test))
```
```python
<class 'list'>
<class 'tuple'>
```
<br>
Convert `tuple` into `list`.
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0])
print(type(tuple_test))

list_test = list(tuple_test)
print(type(list_test))
```
```python
<class 'tuple'>
<class 'list'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`Tuple` can use `tuple` as item and also list.
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0], (4,5,6))

tuple_test
```
```python
('White', 13, ['Blue', 0], (4, 5, 6))
```
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 2.Indexing and Slicing of tuple
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
The methods for indexing and slicing are the same as for lists.
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0], (4,5,6))

# Indexing
print(tuple_test[2])

# Slicing
print(tuple_test[1::-1])
```
```python
['Blue', 0]
(13, 'White')
```
{% include end-box.html %}

# 3.Method of tuple
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`tuple.index()`
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0], (4,5,6))

tuple_test.index((4,5,6))
```
```python
3
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`tuple.count()`
```python
tuple_test = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4)

tuple_test.count(3)
```
```python
3
```
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 4.Packing and Unpacking
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
## 4-1) Packing
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Packing<br>
Omitting the `()` when creating a `tuple` is sometimes called **_packing_**, as it implies you are "packing" multiple objects into one.
```python
tuple_test = "First", "Second", "Third"

print(tuple_test, "\n", type(tuple_test))
```
```python
('First', 'Second', 'Third') 
 <class 'tuple'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

## 4-2) Unpacking
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Unpacking<br>
**_Unpacking_** is the reverse operation, where you assign the items of a tuple to a sequence of variables on the left side of an assignment.
```python
tuple_test = "First", "Second", "Third"

a,b,c = tuple_test

print(a,b,c)
print(type(a), type(b), type(c))
```
```python
First Second Third
<class 'str'> <class 'str'> <class 'str'>
```
<br>
An error will occur if the number of variables does not match the number of items during unpacking.
```python
tuple_test = "First", "Second", "Third"

a,b = tuple_test

print(a,b,c)
print(type(a), type(b), type(c))
```
```python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[24], line 3
      1 tuple_test = "First", "Second", "Third"
----> 3 a,b = tuple_test
      5 print(a,b,c)
      6 print(type(a), type(b), type(c))

ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
```
<br>
If we want to ignore a specific item when unpacking, we can use an underscore `_` as a placeholder to ensure the total number of variables still matches the number of items.
```python
tuple_test = "First", "Second", "Third"

a,b, _ = tuple_test

print(a,b)
print(type(a), type(b))
```
```python
First Second
<class 'str'> <class 'str'>
```
<br>
We can also use unpacking with other sequence types, such as strings and lists.
```python
string_test = "String"

a,b, _, d, _, _ = string_test

print(a,b,d)
print(type(a), type(b), type(d))
```
```python
S t i
<class 'str'> <class 'str'> <class 'str'>
```
<br>
```python
list_test = ["First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth", "Fifth"]

a,b, _, d, _ = list_test

print(a,b,d)
print(type(a), type(b), type(d))
```
```python
First Second Fourth
<class 'str'> <class 'str'> <class 'str'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 5.Immutability of tuple
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We cannot change the contents of a tuple object. 
Consequently, it does not have any methods that would modify it.
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Change of item of tuple
```python
tuple_test = ("First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth", "Fifth")

print(tuple_test[0])

tuple_test[0] = "first"

print(tuple_test[0])
```
```python
First
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[33], line 5
      1 tuple_test = ("First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth", "Fifth")
      3 print(tuple_test[0])
----> 5 tuple_test[0] = "first"
      7 print(tuple_test[0])

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
<br>
`list` vs. `tuple`
```python
import sys

list_test = ["First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth", "Fifth"]
tuple_test = tuple(list_test)

print("Size of list", sys.getsizeof(list_test))
print("Size of tuple", sys.getsizeof(tuple_test))
```
```python
Size of list 104
Size of tuple 80
```
Tuples use less memory than lists. 
In general, lists are convenient when you need to frequently add or remove items. 

On the other hand, tuples take up less memory and are faster to process than lists. 
While they might seem inconvenient because we can't add or remove items, the mutability of a list can sometimes lead to unexpected mistakes or errors. 
For this reason, using a tuple is often the more appropriate and safer choice in many situations.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 6.Sequence
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Data types such as `str`, `list`, `tuple`, and `range` are classified as sequence types. 
The operations below can be used on all sequence objects. 
We can understand these operations intuitively if you remember that a sequence is simply a structure where items are arranged in an order.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`in` and `not in`
```python
tuple_test = ("First", "Second", "Third")

print("First" in tuple_test)
print("Second" not in tuple_test)
```
```python
True
False
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Addition
```python
# Tuple
tuple_test_1 = ("First", "Second")
tuple_test_2 = ("Third", "Fourth")

tuple_test_3 = tuple_test_1 + tuple_test_2

print(tuple_test_3)

# List
list_test_1 = ["First", "Second"]
list_test_2 = ["Third", "Fourth"]

list_test_3 = list_test_1 + list_test_2

print(list_test_3)
```
```python
('First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth')
['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth']
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
We can use indexing and slicing in sequence type data.
```python
# Tuple
tuple_test = ("First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth")

print(tuple_test[1:3])

# List
list_test = ["First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth"]

print(list_test[0:2])
```
```python
('Second', 'Third')
['First', 'Second']
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Check number of items.
```python
# Tuple
tuple_test = ("First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth")

print(len(tuple_test))

# List
list_test = ["First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth"]

print(len(list_test))
```
```python
4
4
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`max()`
```python
# Tuple
tuple_test = ("First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth")

print(max(tuple_test))

# List
list_test = [4, 5, 6, 7]

print(max(list_test))
```
```python
Third
7
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`.index()`
```python
tuple_test = ("First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth")

print(tuple_test.index("First"))
```
```python
0
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`.count()`
```python
list_test = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]

print(list_test.count(2))
```
```python
2
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`range()`
```python
# The range() function is often used together with for loops.
list_test = []
for i in range(0, 11, 2):  # (start, stop, step) is the same as with slicing
    list_test.append(i)

list_test
```
```python
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
