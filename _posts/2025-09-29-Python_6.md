# 0.Introduction
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
`Tuples` are similar to `lists` in that they can hold objects of various data types. 
However, the critical difference is that `tuples` are immutable, which leads to differences in how they are used.
{% include end-box.html %}

# 1.Tuple
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
`Tuples` are created using `()` and `,`. 
However, if a `,` is present, the `()` can sometimes be omitted.

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Various method to make tuple
```python
# An empty tuple
t = ()

# Using `()` and `,`
t = (1, 2, 3)

# Can hold objects of different data types
t = ("Hello", 3.14, 123)

# A trailing `,` is required to create a tuple with a single item. Without it, it's just a string.
t = ("hello",)

# Omitting `()` when creating a tuple is also known as packing.
t = 1, 2, 3    
```
<br>
How to make single item `tuple`.
```python
# A trailing comma is required to create a tuple with a single item. Without it, it's just a string.
t = "hello"
print(type(t))

t = ("hello")
print(type(t))

t = ("hello",)
print(type(t))

```
```python
<class 'str'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'tuple'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Convert `list` into `tuple`.
```python
list_test = ["White", 13, ["Blue", 0]]
print(type(list_test))

tuple_test = tuple(list_test)
print(type(tuple_test))
```
```python
<class 'list'>
<class 'tuple'>
```
<br>
Convert `tuple` into `list`.
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0])
print(type(tuple_test))

list_test = list(tuple_test)
print(type(list_test))
```
```python
<class 'tuple'>
<class 'list'>
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`Tuple` can use `tuple` as item and also list.
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0], (4,5,6))

tuple_test
```
```python
('White', 13, ['Blue', 0], (4, 5, 6))
```
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 2.Indexing and Slicing of tuple
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
The methods for indexing and slicing are the same as for lists.
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0], (4,5,6))

# Indexing
print(tuple_test[2])

# Slicing
print(tuple_test[1::-1])
```
```python
['Blue', 0]
(13, 'White')
```
{% include end-box.html %}

# 3.Method of tuple
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`tuple.index()`
```python
tuple_test = ("White", 13, ["Blue", 0], (4,5,6))

tuple_test.index((4,5,6))
```
```python
3
```
{% include end-box.html %}

{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
`tuple.count()`
```python
tuple_test = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4)

tuple_test.count(3)
```
```python
3
```
{% include end-box.html %}
{% include end-box.html %}

# 4.Packing and Unpacking
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Packing<br>
Omitting the `()` when creating a `tuple` is sometimes called **_packing_**, as it implies you are "packing" multiple objects into one.
```python
tuple_test = "First", "Second", "Third"

print(tuple_test, "\n", type(tuple_test))
```
```python
('First', 'Second', 'Third') 
 <class 'tuple'>
```
{% include start-box.html class="math-box-inner" font_size="0.8em"%}
Unpacking<br>
**_Unpacking_** is the reverse operation, where you assign the items of a tuple to a sequence of variables on the left side of an assignment.
```python
tuple_test = "First", "Second", "Third"

a,b,c = tuple_test

print(a,b,c)
print(type(a), type(b), type(c))
```
```python
First Second Third
<class 'str'> <class 'str'> <class 'str'>
```
