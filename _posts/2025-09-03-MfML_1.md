# Introduction 
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors.
Here, a bold letter represents a vector.

# 1. Systems of Linear Equations
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
<center>$$\begin{align*}a_{11}x_{1} + \cdots + a_{1n}x_{n} &= b_{1} \\&\vdots \\a_{m1}x_{1} + \cdots + a_{mn}x_{n} &= b_{m}\end{align*}, \text{where $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b_i \in \mathbb{R}$.} \tag{1.1}$$</center>

Equation (1.1) is the general form of a **_system of linear equations_**, and $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are the unkowns of this system.
Every n-tuple $(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ that satisfies (1.1) is a **_solution_** of the linear equation system.

$$\begin{array}{c|c|c}\begin{aligned}x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= 3 \\x_1 - x_2 + 2x_3 &= 2 \quad (1.2)\\2x_1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ + 3x_3 &= 1 \end{aligned}&\begin{aligned}x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= 3 \\x_1 - x_2 + 2x_3 &= 2 \quad (1.3)\\\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x_2 + 3x_3 &= 1 \end{aligned}&\begin{aligned}x_1 + x_2 + x_3 &= 3 \\x_1 - x_2 + 2x_3 &= 2 \quad (1.4)\\2x_1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ + 3x_3 &= 5\end{aligned}\end{array}$$

Various system of linear equations is here. 
System of linear equations are can be seperated into three types.
