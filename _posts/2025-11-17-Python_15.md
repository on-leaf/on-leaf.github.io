# Introduction
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
Python is an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** language. 
OOP is a methodology for structuring programs by using objects.

An object bundles together functions (methods) and the data required for those functions to work. 
This helps make it easier to build larger, more complex programs.

An object bundles behaviors (what it can do) and the data needed to perform those behaviors. 
More specifically, it includes the functions that define the behaviors and the variables that hold the data.

Objects are said to be encapsulated, meaning they wrap up their data and behaviors. 
This allows the programmer to use the object without needing to worry about all of its internal details.

# 1. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}
We have already used various kinds of objects. 
For example, let's think about the `str` (string) object.

- `a` and `b` (or more precisely, the objects associated with the names `a` and `b`) hold the data "hello" and "abc".
- "hello" and "abc" have different values but are the same type, so they can be used in the same way. This shows that well-designed data types are easy to reuse.
- `a` and `b` can also perform actions using methods. For example, both `a` and `b` can use the `.upper()` method to change their data.
- When you want to perform an action, you can simply use `.upper()` to "make this uppercase" without caring what specific data is inside `a` or `b`.

```python
a = str("hello")
b = str("abc")

print(type(a), type(b))  # <class 'str'> <class 'str'>

a.upper(), b.upper() # 'HELLO', 'ABC'
```
```python
<class 'str'> <class 'str'>

('HELLO', 'ABC')
```

Here are some advantages of OOP:

- You don't need to know the internal details.
- It's easy to reuse well-designed data types.
- You can design the program's structure from an abstract perspective.

Let's summarize the important terms.

- **Object** : In Python, everything is an object. More specifically, it refers to a bundle of data and functionality.
- **Class** : A template that defines what data an object will have and what functions it can perform. In other words, it defines a data type. 
- **Instance** : Since everything in Python is an object, the concept of an object is very important. When you want to emphasize that an object was created according to a specific class, you call that object an instance of that class. : For example, in `a = str("hello")`, `a` is an instance of the `str` class. : "Object" and "instance" are often used interchangeably.
- **Attribute** : The components that make up a class are called attributes. In Python, anything that can be used by placing a dot (`.`) after a variable is called an attribute.
- **Data Attribute** : Refers to the variables that are part of an object (or class).
- **Method** : Refers to the functions that belong to an object (or class).

    Ex) Think of a TV Class<br>
    Data Attributes: Size, Color, Current Channel<br>
    Methods: Turn on/off, Change Channel, Volume Control

To check which class an object is an instance of, you can use the `isinstance()` function.
```python
a = str("hello")
b = str("abc")

# Use isinstance() to check what type of instance an object is.
isinstance(a, str), isinstance(b, str) # (True, True)
```
```python
(True, True)
```
{% include end-box.html %}

# 2. Creating a Data Type with `Class`
{% include start-box.html class="math-box"%}

## 2-1) Creating a Data Type with `Class`
You can create and use your own necessary data types by using the `class` syntax.

[Definition of a Class]
- Class Name
- Methods
- Data Attributes

```
class MyInt:                   
    def __init__(self, value):   
        self.v = value         
                               
    def add(self, a):
        self.v = self.v + a
